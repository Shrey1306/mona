<p>Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: COPD exacerbation/Shortness of Breath</p>

<p>Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation arterial line placement PICC line placement Esophagogastroduodenoscopy</p>

<p> History of Present Illness: 87 yo F with h/o CHF, COPD on 5 L oxygen at baseline, tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, presents with acute dyspnea over several days, and lethargy. This morning patient developed an acute worsening in dyspnea, and called EMS. EMS found patient tachypnic at saturating 90% on 5L. Patient was noted to be tripoding. She was given a nebulizer and brought to the ER. . According the patient's husband, she was experiencing symptoms consistent with prior COPD flares. Apparently patient was without cough, chest pain, fevers, chills, orthopnea, PND, dysuria, diarrhea, confusion and neck pain. Her husband is a physician and gave her a dose of levaquin this morning. . In the ED, patient was saturating 96% on NRB. CXR did not reveal any consolidation. Per report EKG was unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation revealed a leukocytosis if 14 and lactate of 2.2. Patient received combivent nebs, solumedrol 125 mg IV x1, aspirin 325 mg po x1. Mg sulfate 2 g IV x1, azithromycin 500 mg IVx1, levofloxacin 750 mg IVx1, and Cefrtiaxone 1g IVx1. Patient became tachpnic so was trialed on non-invasive ventilation but became hypotensive to systolics of 80, so noninvasive was removed and patient did well on NRB and nebulizers for about 2 hours. At that time patient became agitated, hypoxic to 87% and tachypnic to the 40s, so patient was intubated. Post intubation ABG was 7.3/60/88/31. Propafol was switched to fentanyl/midazolam for hypotension to the 80s. Received 2L of NS. On transfer, patient VS were 102, 87/33, 100% on 60% 450 x 18 PEEP 5. Patient has peripheral access x2. . In the ICU, patient appeared comfortable.</p>

<p>CXR ([**2124-7-21**]) - IMPRESSION: Hiatal hernia, otherwise unremarkable. Limited exam.</p>

<p>Echo ([**2124-7-24**]) - There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.</p>

<p>CXR ([**2124-8-5**]) - Kyphotic positioning. Compared with one day earlier and allowing for technical differences, the right-sided effusion may be slightly larger. Otherwise, no significant change is detected. Again seen is retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and a small left effusion. As noted, a right effusion is again seen, possibly slightly larger on the current examination, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Doubt CHF. Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.</p>

<p>Brief Hospital Course: 87 yo F with h/o CHF, COPD on 5 L oxygen at baseline, tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, presents with acute dyspnea over several days, no s/p intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure.</p>

<p># Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Presents with dyspnea, but no clear cough or fevers. Per report, patient felt like this with prior COPD exacerbations. Leukocytosis supports possible pneumonia, but history and CXR not entirely consistent with this. EKG with signs of demand, but ROMI negative. Sputum gram stain unremarkable, but respitatory viral culture grew parainfluenze type 3 on [**7-24**]. Patient was initially managed on solumedrol 60 mg IV Q8H, and was eventually tapered. With no evidence of pneumonia on CXR and sputum gram stain, antibiotics were stopped [**7-25**]. Beta-agonists and anticholinergics were continued around the clock. TTE revealed mild symmetric lvh with normal ef, increased pcwp (>18mmHg), Normal RV, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On [**7-26**], bronchoscopy revealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. Patient had difficulty weaning from the vent, and would become interimittenty hypertensive to SBP 200s and tachypnic to the 50s. Patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing SBT 0/5, but required re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening secretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. Of note, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have MRSA growing in sputum samples. Although it was felt that this likely represented colonization as opposed to true infection, the patient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped after 5 days). After multiple discussions between the patient's family and the ICU team, the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the palliative care service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she would not want a tracheostomy. On [**2124-8-3**], extubation was pursued again and was successful. After extubation, her respiratory status improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical floor. On the floor she was progressively weaned to 2LNC with nebs (better than her baseline 5L @home). Because of clinical exams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently diuresed. She also experienced intermittent shortness of breath with tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks of anxiety with tachypnea. After receiving prn morphine, her breathing status would typically improve. A steroid taper was begun. The patient should continue prednisone 30 mg daily for 3 more days, then 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg daily for 4 days, then 5 mg daily for 4 days, then stop. . # Upper GI bleeding: On [**7-22**], patient had coffee grounds from OG tube. Lavage for approx 600ccs with clearance. GI perfomred EGD which revealed esophagitis, ulcers and blood in the stomach body, D2 diverticulum and large hiatal hernia. H pylori was negative. Patient was continued on IV PPI, with plan for repeat EGD in 8 weeks, and upper GI series once clinically improved given abnormal anatomy on EGD. Her hematocrit remained stable with no further episodes of upper GI bleeding throughout the patient's hospitalization. On the floor she was switched to PO pantoprazole twice daily. Aspirin was held. . # Weakness: The patient was found to have generalized weakness at the end of her hospitalization. Neurology was consulted and they felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy and deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. A TSH was checked which was normal. They recommended pulmonary and physical rehab. . # CAD: History of LAD and RCA stenosis on Cath, but no stents. Continued statin and beta blocker, but held aspirin for GI bleeding (see above) . # Nutrition: Unable to pass NG without direct visualization due to hiatal hernia. IR guided post pyloric NG tube was placed on [**7-26**] for TFs and po medications. NG tube was pulled when patient was extubated on [**2124-8-3**]. Speech and swallow were consulted following the patient's extubation and she was eventually moved to soft solids and thin liquids with 1:1 supervision.</p>

<p># Goals of care: PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1407**] was very involved in discussions regarding patient's code status. Palliative care also followed along with the patient. Ultimately, at the time of the patient's extubation on [**2124-8-3**], it was decided that the patient would be DNR/DNI (although this was later change). The patient's family felt that she would not want a tracheostomy. It was decided that she would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status were to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on comfort. However, her status improved in the MICU and on the floor and it was then decided that she would remain DNR with intubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated. After several days with stable or improved overall clinical status, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. At the timem of discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate, okay to intubate.</p>

<p>==================  RADIOLOGY ==================</p>

<p>CT scan C spine [**2162-3-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Fracture of the C6 as described involving the right pedicle (extending to the inferior facet) and left lamina. Anterior widening at the C6-7 disc space and mild widening of left C6-7 facet also noted. Prevertebral hematoma at C6 with likely rupture of the anterior longitudinal ligament.</p>

<p>2. Lucency in the right posterior C1 ring may represent a chronic injury. Likely old avulsion fracture at T2 pedicle on the left.</p>

<p>3. Ossification of both anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments with compromise of the central spinal canal. Degenerative disease is further described above.</p>

<p>CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS ([**2162-3-3**]) IMPRESSION: 1. No acute injuries in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis. 2. Three discrete pleural fluid collections in the right hemithorax, likely pseudotumors. 3. Small hypodense lesion in the pancreatic body is of unclear etiology, may represent pseudicyst or cystic tumor. Further evaluation with MRI may be performed on a non- emergent basis. 4. Bilateral renal cysts. 5. Foley catheter balloon inflated within the prostatic urethra. Recommend emergent repositioning.</p>

<p>CT SINUS/MAXILLOFACIAL ([**2162-3-3**]) 1. Bilateral nasal bone fractures. 2. Left frontal scalp hematoma with preseptal soft tissue swelling. Question foreign body anterior to the left globe. Recommend clinical correlation. Small amount of extraconal hematoma in the superior aspect of the left orbit. 3. Linear lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Correlate with CT C- spine performed concurrently.</p>

<p>HEAD CT ([**2162-3-3**]) 1. No acute intracranial hemprrhage. 2. Left frontal scalp hematoma. 3. Nasal bone fractures. Recommend correlation with report from facial bone CT scan. 4. Lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Please refer to dedeicated CT C-spine for further detail. 5. Left cerebellar encephalomalacia, likely due to old infarction.</p>

<p>CHEST [**2162-3-10**] The Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm with its tip most likely terminating in the stomach. The bilateral pacemakers are demonstrated with one lead terminating in right atrium and three leads terminating in right ventricle. The patient is in mild pulmonary edema with no change in the loculated pleural fluid within the major fissure.</p>

<p>CT HEAD [**2162-3-11**] 1. A tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage layers along the occipital horns of the ventricles bilaterally. Recommend followp imaging. 2. Left frontal scalp hematoma has decreased in size. 3. Unchanged left cerebellar encephalomalacia. 4. Nasal bone fractures are better evaluated on dedicated maxillofacial CT.</p>

<p>RIGHT SHOULDER X-RAY ([**2162-3-11**]) Mild glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis. Nonspecific ossification projecting over the upper margin of the scapular body and adjacent to the lesser tuberosity. Diagnostic considerations include the sequela of chronic calcific bursitis, intraarticular bodies, and/or calcific tendinitis of the subscapularis tendon. Increased opacity projecting over the right hemithorax and minor fissure, better delineated on recent chest radiographs and chest CT</p>

<p>RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([**2162-3-13**]) 1. Deep venous thrombosis in the right axillary vein, extending proximally into the right subclavian vein, and distally to involve the brachial veins, portion of the basilic vein, and the right cephalic vein. 2. Likely 2.0 cm left axillary lymph node, with unusual son[**Name (NI) 493**] features somewhat suspicious for malignancy. Followup ultrasound is recommended in 4 weeks, and FNA/biopsy may be considered at that time if no interval improvement.</p>

<p>[**2162-3-14**] CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, on the right with a loculated appearance. There is associated compressive atelectasis. The visualized portion of the heart suggests mild cardiomegaly. There is no pericardial effusion. There is a 9-mm hypoattenuating, well-defined lesion in the left lobe of the liver (2:12) too small to accurately characterize but statistically most likely representing a cyst. There are bilateral, partially exophytic renal cysts. The spleen is normal in size. There is a 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic body, most likely representing focal fat. The gallbladder and adrenal glands are unremarkable. An NG tube terminates in the stomach. There is no ascites. The large and small bowel loops appear unremarkable without wall thickening or pneumatosis. Oral contrast material has passed into the ascending colon without evidence of obstruction. There is no ascites and no free air. There is a small pocket of air in the left rectus muscle, tracking over a distance of approximately 10 cm.</p>

<p>CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The pelvic small and large bowel loops, collapsed bladder containing Foley catheter and seminal vesicles appear unremarkable. The prostate is enlarged, measuring 5.9 cm in transverse diameter. The rectum contains a moderate amount of dried stool. There is no free air or free fluid.</p>

<p>BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is DISH of the entire visualized thoracolumbar spine. There also are degenerative changes about the hip joints with large acetabular osteophytes.</p>

<p>IMPRESSION: 1. Stable bilateral pleural effusions, loculated on the right. 2. New focus of air tracking within the left rectus muscle with associated tiny amount of extraperitoneal air (2:53). No associated stranding or fluid collection. Please correlate clinically if this could be iatrogenic, such as due to s.q. injections. 3. 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic body. This could represent focal fat, although a cystic tumor cannot be excluded. If this is of concern, then MRI is again recommended for further evaluation. 4. Hypoattenuating focus in the left lobe of the liver, too small to accurately characterize. 5. Bilateral partially exophytic renal cysts. 6. Moderate amount of dried stool within the rectum.</p>

<p>A wet read was placed and the pertinent findings were discussed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1831**] [**Name (STitle) 1832**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1833**] at 11:30 p.m. on [**2162-3-14**].</p>

<p>[**2162-3-16**] VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW FINDINGS: Real-time video fluoroscopic evaluation was performed after oral administration of thin and puree consistency of barium, in conjunction with the speech pathologist.</p>

<p>ORAL PHASE: Normal bolus formation, bolus control, AP tongue movement, oral transit time, and no oral cavity residue.</p>

<p>PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There is normal swallow initiation and velar elevation. There is mild-to-moderate impairment of laryngeal elevation with absent epiglottic deflection. There is moderate-to-severe increase in pharyngeal transit time. There is residue in the valleculae and piriform sinuses with moderate impairment of bolus propulsion. There was aspiration of both thin and puree barium.</p>

<p>IMPRESSION: Aspiration of thin liquids and puree. For additional information, please see the speech and swallow therapist's report from the same day.</p>

<p>[**2162-3-18**] CT Head w/out: FINDINGS: There is a small amount of blood layering in the occipital horns of both lateral ventricles, unchanged though not as dense given evolution. No new hemorrhage is identified. The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are enlarged secondary to involutional change. Periventricular white matter hyperdensities are sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia. Encephalomalacia in the left cerebellar hemisphere secondary to old infarction is unchanged. The osseous structures are unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. Skin staples are noted along the superior- posterior neck secondary to recent spinal surgery.</p>

<p>IMPRESSION: No interval change with a very small intraventricular hemorrhage.</p>

<p>No discharge labs as patient CMO.</p>

<p>Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] was seen at [**Hospital1 18**] after his fall from a height of approximatly 10 feet. CT scans of his chest, abdomen and pelvis were negative for pathology. CT scan of his C-spine showed fracture of anterior and posterior elements at C6-7. He was also shown to have a right nasal bone fracture.</p>

<p>C-spine fracture: Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] two surgical procedures to stabilized his c-spine. [**2162-3-4**]: anterior cervical decompression/fusion at C6-7. [**2162-3-5**]: Cervical laminectomy C6-C7 &amp; T1 with Posterior cervical arthrodesis C4-T1. He tolerated the procedures well. He was extubated without complication.</p>

<p>After his surgical procedures, Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] was transfered to the medicine service at [**Hospital1 18**] for his medical care. While on the medicine service, patient was found to be persistently aspirating and failed his speech and swallow evaluation. Patient and family were not interested in an NG tube or PEG for nutrition. Patient also developed a venous clot of the right upper extremity and the decision was made to not proceed with medical treatment. Goals of care were changed to comfort measures only. A foley was placed after patient had difficulty with urinary retention and straight cathing. A palliative care consult was obtained for symptom management and patient was discharged to hospice with morphine, olanzapine, and a foley in place for symptomatic relief.</p>

The patient was in rehab after being discharged from here for PE. She was scheduled to be discharged on [**12-6**]; on the day prior to discharge she deveoped fever, hypoxia, and SOB. CXR showed b/t lower lobe infiltrates. She was started on levoflox and ceftriaxone on [**12-5**]. When she became hypoxic on NC they brought her in to the ED. . In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED she was febrile to 102.7, P 109 BP 135/56 R 34 O2 90% on 3L. She was started on vanc and zosyn for broader coverage, tylenol, and 2L NS. . The patient reports having sweats and cough before admission. She complains of SOB and some upper back pain. She denies chest pain, URI sx, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, or dysuria. Of note she had had a rash and was given prednisone for 7 days, ending [**12-3**]. The rash was speculated to be due to coumadin, but she was able to be continued on coumadin.</p>

<p>Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain</p>

<p>Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central venous line insertion (right internal jugular vein)</p>

<p>History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] is an 84 yo man with moderate aortic stenosis (outside hospital echo in [**2124**] with [**Location (un) 109**] 1 cm2, gradient 28 mmHg, moderate mitral regurgitation, mild aortic insufficiency), chronic left ventricular systolic heart failure with EF 25-30%, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, CAD s/p CABG in [**2099**] with SVG-LAD-Diagonal, SVG-OM, and SVG-RPDA-RPL, with a re-do CABG in [**9-/2117**] with LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-diagonal, and SVG-RCA. He also has severe peripheral arterial disease s/p peripheral bypass surgery. He presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital ER this morning with shortness of breath and chest pain and was found to be in heart failure.</p>

<p>He states he was in his usual state of health until 10:30 last evening when he woke up feeling cold; 1 hour later he developed moderate to severe sharp chest pain radiating across his chest associated with nausea, diaphoresis, and dypsnea. The pain was fairly constant and did not resolve until he was given sL NTG at 6 am by EMS. He has been pain free since. Presenting vitals BP 109/66, HR 71, O2 sat 88% on RA. CXR showed congestive heart failure; initial troponin-I was mildly elevated at 0.4, CK 70. He given aspirin and furosemide 80 mg IV (with ~600cc diuresis), Nitropaste [**1-3**]&quot;, and Lovenox 80 mg SQ. During the ambulance transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], he also received ~500 cc IVF for ? low BP).</p>

<p>On further questioning, Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] has very poor exercise tolerance due to knee pain that he attributes to osteoarthritis. But he says that he gets chest pain (similar to pain he had last night) with fairly minimal exertion (picking up his 11 lb cat, carrying 1 gallon jug of water, first getting up from sitting to walk outside or to walk to the bedroom). The pain is associated with dyspnea and is relieved with few minutes rest. His symptoms occur about every day to every other day and have been stable over the past year. He denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, but does endorse exertional dyspnea (he cannot identify the amount of exertion required). Currently, he is dyspneic and feels somewhat better sitting up; he reports no chest pain.</p>

<p>ROS is also positive for a nose bleed requiring ED visit several months ago (and cessation of Plavix for a few days), and currently gross hematuria after Foley placement and Lovenox.</p>

<p>Past Medical History: 1. Coronary artery disease s/p CABG twice (vide infra). 2. Hypertension. 3. Diabetes mellitus. 4. Hyperlipidemia. 5. Peripheral arterial disease with occluded left common iliac artery, S/P right iliac artery stenting and femoral-to-femoral bypass, further angioplasty to the right profunda. 5. Ischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic LV systolic heart failure, reported LVEF 25-30%. 6. Moderate-severe aortic stenosis. 7. Osteoarthritis.</p>

<p>CAD: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension</p>

<p>Cardiac History: CABG in [**2099**] (SVG-LAD-Diagonal, SVG-OM, and SVG-RPDA-RPL), with a re-do CABG in [**9-/2117**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-diagonal, and SVG-RCA)</p>

<p>Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2120**] anatomy as follows: Patent SVG to OM1, patent SVG to PDA which filled the distal PDA as well as the R-PL via a jump segment. Stump occlusion of a graft presumably to the right system as well as one stump that could be documented of a graft to the left. Other SVG's were not able to be selectively engaged. Supravalvular aortography demonstrated no other patent grafts. Patent LIMA to mid-LAD, which also back-perfused the diagonal via a patent jump graft that was interposed between the LAD and the diagonal.</p>

<p>Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use. There is no history of alcohol abuse.</p>

<p>Family History: There is extensive family history of early coronary disease (father died of MI at 44, one brother died in 40's, one in 50's, sister had stroke).</p>

<p>ECG [**2125-2-9**] 9:36:38 PM Rhythm is most likely sinus rhythm with frequent ventricular premature beats with occasional ventricular bigeminal pattern. There are also frequent atrial premature beats. Intraventricular conduction defect. Left ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave changes most likely related to left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2124-4-9**] ventricular premature beats are more frequent, as are atrial premature beats. Clinical correlation is suggested.</p>

<p>CXR [**2125-2-9**]: The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG. The heart size appears slightly enlarged compared to the previous study. Bilateral perihilar haziness continues toward the lower lungs is new consistent with new moderate- to-severe pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural effusion is present, also new, most likely part of the heart failure. Left and right retrocardiac opacities consistent with atelectasis.</p>

<p>ECHO [**2125-2-11**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolaterl walls. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 25-30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.6 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior report (images unavailable of [**2119-5-8**], left ventricular systolic function is now depressed and the severity of aortic stenosis has increased.</p>

<p>Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 84 yo man with CAD s/p CABG twice with daily angina, presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, and congestive heart failure.</p>

<p># CAD: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup and treatment of chest pain. A chest X-ray performed on admission showed moderate-severe pulmonary edema. He did have a stably elevated troponin thought to be related to acute heart failure or demand ischemia. He was started on a Lasix drop at 10 mg/hr for initiation of diuresis. He initially tolerated this well, however at approximately 8 pm on [**2125-2-10**], Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] was transferred from the floor to the CCU after complaining of chest pain when he was sitting in bed after dinner. As he was being evaluated by the housestaff, he became unresponsive and developed pulseless electrical arrest. Chest compressions were started, but within approximately 2 minutes, he became responsive and regained a palpable pulse. His rhythm appeared to be atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate initially in the 50s but rising to the 110's. Review of his telemetry showed that he had developed atrial fibillation earlier in the evening without obvious ventricular arrhythmias immediately prior to his arrest (which was attributed to a vasovagal episode in the setting of heart failure and aortic stenosis). On transfer to the CCU, he was started on levophed for hypotension and amiodarone IV for AFib. Chest x-ray on [**2125-2-10**] showed interval worsening of pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. At this time his cardiac enzymes became very elevated with EKG changes consistent of a NSTEMI with a CK to 1006 and troponin to 3.82. On [**2125-2-11**], he had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls. LVEF was 25-30 %, with severe aortic stenosis and [**1-3**]+ mitral regurgitation. He was aggressively diuresed with an IV Lasix drip with improvement in his oxygen requirement and chest x-ray. Levophed was discontinued on [**2-12**], and blood pressures remained stable off pressors with MAP's 60 - 70. On [**2125-2-13**], he was transferred back to the floor team on PO amiodarone. He remained in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry on po amiodarone, and diuresis was continued with a Lasix drip with good urine output and improvement of renal function. He remained asymptomatic with no shortness of breath or chest pain after transfer. He was maintained on a heparin drip bridging to Coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. His metoprolol was held for hypotension in the ICU and relative hypotension with SBP in 90s and low 100s upon transfer to the floor. ACE-inhibitor was held due to relative hypotension and renal insufficiency with Creat 1.7. A cardiac surgery consult deemed him an acceptable candidate for a 3rd open heart surgery for aortic valve replacement pending re-assessment of his coronary anatomy. The intermediate-term plan was to allow recovery from the current episode and discussion as an outpatient with his primary cardiologist regarding the risks and benefits of aortic valve replacement.</p>

<p>On [**2-16**], the patient became hypotensive to SBPs to 60s-70s after getting into a chair after breakfast. He was given 1L NS with no response in BP. The patient was mentating but became short of breath with IVF. He had worsening EKG changes. He was started on Levophed without improvement in his blood pressure. He was brought to the catherization laboratory for potential emergent aortic valvuloplasty and was intubated. At that point, he suffered a PEA arrest and could not be resuscitated. He was pronounced deceased at 12:33pm.</p>

<p># Pump: As above. The patient had severe pulmonary edema with initial exam revealing crackles throughout his lung fields. He was treated with a Lasix drip which was transitioned on [**2-16**] to po Lasix 80 mg po twice daily.</p>

<p># Rhythm: Patient was in NSR on admission. On HD #2, he had chest pain, then went into PEA arrest as described above. Telemetry showed atrial fibrillation prior to the event. In the CCU, he was started on amiodarone 400 mg po tid to be tapered over the subsequent weeks.</p>

<p># Acute renal failure: Renal function initially declined (creatinine to 2.1), then improved on Lasix gtt, but stayed 1.7 - 1.9 (above baseline of 1.3).</p>

<p># Hematuria: He had hematuria (no clots) after traumatic Foley placement at the outside hospital. The catheter was removed on [**2-16**] with gradual resolution of hematuria.</p>

<p># Diabetes: Due to acute renal failre, metformin was discontinued and the patient was maintained on a Humalog sliding scale with 30 units of Lantus at bedtime.</p>

<p># Hematoma. The patient developed a small hematoma at the site of his right internal jugular venous access after catheter removal. This was treated with local compression.</p>

Now p/w 1wk h/o diarrhea worsened one day prior to admission, found to have wbcc 30 in ED, admitted [**4-19**] and started on both p.o. vanco and IV flagyl. Began to have brbpr on [**4-25**], on [**4-30**] had flex sigmoidoscopy showing pseudomembranes with recurrent c.diff vs. bowel ischemia as etiology. Then developed some sob/fluid overload and was started on lasix and neseritide gtt's. Had had some intermittent afib which was thought to be contributing to presumed diastolic dysfunction. Tx to CCU [**2192-5-12**] for worsening tachypnea and oliguria on nesiritide and lasix gtt. Was cardioverted chemically with good result. Also developed acute on chronic renal failure for which nephrology has been following, zenith of 6.0, now back at baseline creatinine of 2.0's.</p>

<p> Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo f w/ h/o CRI, htn, h/o nephrotic syndrome, w/ diarrhea, c.diff pos at rehab, failure to respond to flagyl, w/ elev wbc, and negative ct. A brief-problem based hospital course is outlined below.</p>

<p>1) presumed c.diff infxn- Admitted and started on p.o. vancomyin and IV metronidazole, w/ addition of levofloxacin for broad spectrum coverage given recent abd surgery. Cholestyramine was initially given for toxin binding. WBC was 30 on admission and trended down with ABX; however, C.diff toxin neg x5, so diagnosis remains presumptive. C. diff B toxin was sent and was negative as well. She completed a 3 week course of PO vanco and IV flagyl antibiotics, which was completed on [**5-14**]. She subsequently remained afebrile without further diarrhea, and was able to tolerate PO's.</p>

<p>2) [**Name (NI) 1866**] Pt began having episodes of BRBPR on [**4-25**] with resultant slow HCT drop. GI and surgery were consulted. Pt had no abdominal pain, but given recent surgery and low albumin, we were concerned that the bleed may be evidence of ischemic bowel or dehiscence. Pt was also having intermittent episodes of tachycardia, raising the possibility that she was having embolic phenomena with acute ischemia. However, she had no abdominal pain to suggest this. Colonoscopy was done on [**4-30**], showing severe c dif vs. ischemic bowel. Surgery found that pt was not surgical candidate and believed her bleeding and mucosal damage was [**2-29**] c dif and would continue to improve. Biopsy results showed no evidence of c.dif, but given pt's tenuous status, po vanco and iv flagyl were continued while awaiting toxin B. It is quite possible that the mucosal changes seen on colonoscopy were the result of C dif infxn, which had been treated w/ABX and resolved, leaving the mucosae to heal. As well, GI felt there may be a superimposed ischemic insult. No further work-up was performed since she had good clinical resolution of her colitis, following completion of cdiff treatment.</p>

<p>2) acute renal failure w/ CRI- Renal team was consulted on admisison. Baseline cr is approx 2.0. On admission this was significantly elevated to 4.1. FENA was c/w prerenal etiology and patient had R IJ placed in ED, started on NS for volume resusciation. This was undertaken slowly given that pt had an albumin of 1.4 and pleural effusions were noted on CT. Fluids were changed to 1/2NS w/ bicarb on HD2. Cr trended down each day and the patient has maintained oxygenation. Alb/cr ratio not c/w nephrotic range proteinuria- thus it was felt that the low alb was likely multifactorial. Pt initially required boluses of 500cc NS to maintain Uop ~20-30cc/hr. With hydration and improvement in her diarrhea, her Cr steadily decreased and returned to baseline of 1.6. She was seen by renal who felt that her increase in creatinine may have been secondary to ATN/hypotension and recommended avoiding aggressive overdiuresis. She did subsequently require aggressive diuresis given her rapid afib/chf with lasix and niseritide drips. However her creatinine remained at baseline of 1.7-2.0 with diuresis. She did develop a transient metabolic alkalosis, which was felt likely from volume contraction alkalosis. Therefore her lasix was weaned to 40mg daily and her bicarb trended back down to 30. Her creatinine was stable at 1.6 at the time of discharge.</p>

<p>3) [**Name (NI) 1867**] Pt was noted to be mildly thrombocytopenic on admisison. Unclear why it was low when patient presented. Most likely [**2-29**] extreme inflammatory/SIRS response (given elev lactate on admission). Her PLT count dropped to 95 and DIC workup and HIT Ab were sent, both negative. Her PLT count rose as her clinical condition improved and remained in normal range for the duration of her hosital course.</p>

<p>4) HTN - Pt's baseline SBP is in the 180s-200s range. On admission, BP was low [**2-29**] 3rd spacing and early sepsis. Her BP responded to fluids and she remained relatively normotensive. She was continued on metoprolol for HR/BP control and isordil/hydral was added for afterload reduction.</p>

<p>5) CHF - Evidence of CHF on initial CXR. Her EF was found to be 40% (previously normal), bringing up concern for ischemic event precipitating her failure. In support of this she was noted to have wall motion abnormalities on ECHO with inferoseptal/basal hypokinesis. Diagnostic catheritization was not performed due to her renal insufficiency and decompensated CHF. She was managed medically, and on [**5-10**] the CHF service was consulted for management. She was initiated on aggressive diuresis with IV lasix for goal -1.5L per day. She was transferred to the CCU briefly on [**5-12**] for more tailored therapy and diuresis for her CHF (lasix boluses and nesiritide) with good effect (negative approximately 500 cc overnight). She was transferred back to the floor on lasix boluses.</p>

<p>Due to continued evidence of volume overload she was given 160mg IV [**Month/Year (2) 1868**] + started on lasix drip at 10mg/hr. Then started nesiritide [**Month/Year (2) 1868**] (1mcg/kg) followed by gtt at 0.01mcg/kg/min. Diuresed well to this and maintained BP well, however after increasing natrecor to 0.015, went back into rapid afib. Stopped natrecor on [**5-17**]. Stopped lasix gtt on [**5-18**] given persistent good diuresis. Now tapered down to 40mg daily lasix/day + afterload reduction w/ Isordil/Hydral on [**5-22**]. At the time of discharge, she was felt to be euvolemic with goal of matching ins and outs daily. We will continue her on this regimen upon discharge.</p>

<p>7. Atrial fibrillation: Initially converted from RAF by medical cardioversion performed with procainamide gtt in the CCU at 13mg/kg/hr x10min load followed by 2mg/hr for 2h trial. Became hypotensive to 60's systolic, but subsequently recovered. Then again went into RAF on [**5-17**] early am. Initially HR controlled w/ IV lopressor/IV dilt. Then [**Hospital 1869**] medical cardioversion w/ procainamide. Became hypotensive to 70's systolic after about 10 minutes on procainamide [**Last Name (LF) 1868**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was stopped and her blood pressures normalized. She then converted 10 min later to NSR. She has been in NSR the remainder of her hospital course. She is not on coumadin due to risk for bleed. In addition, amiodorone was discussed as a medical option for continued rythm control. However, given the side effect profile, the family and patient were more comfortable with holding off on adding amiodorone at this time. They understand that there is a higher risk of conversion back to atrial fibrillation and increased risk for stroke without amiodorone. We will continue rate control with metoprolol as mentioned at 25mg TID, and may titrate up as needed to maintain HR <80.</p>

<p>8. CAD- wall motion abnormalities on ECHO w/ inferoseptal/basal HK. currently chest pain free. continuing with medical management. On statin/b-blocker. No plan for cath at this time given her renal insuff/co-morbiditites. Also holding off on aspirin currently given her bleed risk. This will be re-addressed as an outpatient through her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].</p>

<p>9. Anemia- Initially had episode of GI bleed with blood loss anemia requiring 3 units of packed red blood cells. Hematocrit subsequently normalized. However, she subsequently was noted to have a low, but stable, hematocrit at 28-29. Repeat stool guaiacs were all negative and she had no further evidence of bleed or hemolysis. Iron stores were also found to be within normal limits, with low TIBC and high ferritin suggesting anemia of chronic disease. This was felt likely secondary to chronic renal insufficiency. She was started on EPO 2,000 Units q m,w,fr on [**5-22**]. The goal transfusion criteria would be 30 given her history of CAD, however, we have held off on further transfusion at this time given her known CHF with recent severe volume overload. We have set transfusion goal at hct>28, and transfused with 1 unit packed red blood cells and 20mg IV lasix for hct <28.</p>

<p>10. tachypnea- Resolved. Her transient tachypnea was felt likely secondary to volume overload. There was no evidence of infiltrate by CXR. Her ABG at the time on [**5-15**] showed 7.29/43/99. Her respiratory status subsequently improved that same day on [**5-15**] following IV lasix and atrovent nebulizers. Avoided albuterol nebulizers over concern for tachycardia.</p>

<p>11. F/E/N- Started on TPN for nutritional supplementation. She also had a swallow study which showed ability to tolerated regular solids and thin liquids. She has been taking in PO's as tolerated, but has continued to require TPN to reach nutritional goals. This will be continued upon discharge at rehab.</p>

The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is a large circumferential pericardial effusion. Stranding is visualized within the pericardial space c/w some organization. There is left atrial diastolic collapse. There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology. There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.</p>

<p>Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-10-20**], large pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of tamponade is new. .

Successful pericardiocentesis with drainage of 1500ml of blood stained fluid. . ECHO ([**2203-11-4**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal [intrinsic function is likely depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]. There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened and appear shortened/remnants that do not fully coapt.

Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. There is a very small, partially echo filled pericardial effusion.</p>

<p>Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-8**], the findings are similar.</p>

<p> Brief Hospital Course: 41 year old male with HIV/AIDS, previous R-sided endocarditis and severe TR, presented in cardiac tamponade from rehabilitation.</p>

<p>CARDIAC TAMPONADE: On admission, he was transferred to the cardiac catherization lab, where over one liter of fluid was drained from his pericardial space. The fluid was sent for gram stain, culture, AFB, [**Doctor First Name **], TB PCR as well as viral studies and cytology. A pericardial drain was initially left in place, but given minimal drainage over 24 hours, was pulled prior to his transfer to the floor. The etiology of the pericardial effusion is unknown. He was followed by Cardiology on the floor and the initial plan was for a pericardial window, for both tissue and to prevent reaccumulation of fluid. The patient refused the procedure at this time. He will follow up as an outpatient to re-evaluate for the procedure. The effusion was followed by serial ECHO while the patient was in the hospital. There was no evidence of re-accumulation. He is scheduled for an outpatient ECHO in several weeks to evaluate the pericardial space for reaccumlation of effusion.</p>

<p>ATRIAL FIBRILLATION/FLUTTER: Per multiple EKGs, the patient appears to have developed new a fib/flutter. Given his guaiac positive stools, it is not advisable to start anticoagulation at this time. The patient is being rate controlled on a low dose of beta-blocker, which appears to be effective. He will be followed by outpatient Cardiology.</p>

<p>ANEMIA: The patient had a hematocrit drop during this admission.  His lab studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease, however, the patient was found to have guaiac positive stools. GI was consulted and recommeded colonoscopy and EGD. The patient was unable to tolerate the prep and thus the colonoscopy was cancelled. His EGD demonstrated gastritis and thrush. He was started on fluconazole to treat the thrush. He was also transfused two units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate hematocrit response.</p>

<p>HIV/AIDS: The patient had a CD4 count checked during his last admission, it was found to be 132 with a viral load >100K. Given his past noncompliance with HAART therapy and the risk of developing drug resistant HIV, HAART was not restarted. Pt is willing to restart HARRT, and the plan remains to restart medications at rehabilitation. Bactrim was continued for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].</p>

<p>OSTEOMYELITIS: The patient was previously admitted for left ankle pain. He was followed previously by both the orthopedic and ID services. Both services continued to follow the patient on this admission. The patient was continued on 6 weeks of IV antibiotics (last day of cefazolin [**2203-12-5**]), although the dose was decreased to 1g q6 because of a low white blood count.</p>

<p>SEVERE TRICUSPID REGURGITATION: Pt with known grade 4 TR and flail leaflet which he deveoped after acute bacterial endocarditis roughly 10 years ago. We restarted his lasix and spironolactone on this admission.</p>

<p>HCV: HCV viral load checked, and found to be 1.5 million. No further therapy initiated.</p>

<p>ANXIETY: Pt with history of anxiety and on Klonapin at home. His home regimen was continued.</p>

<p>ESOPHAGEAL CANDIDIASIS: Patient was found to have thrush on EGD.  He was started on a course of fluconazole given his immunosupressed state. He is being discharged to complete a two week course of anti-fungal medication.</p>

<p>HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 81-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma with known metastases to the liver and lung who status post resection in the 90s with recurrence in [**2146**] status post treatment with Taxol.</p>

<p>She presented to the Emergency Room on [**2152-10-3**], with altered mental status, decreased p.o. intake, confusion and headache over several weeks, and was found to have three mass lesions in her brain on head CT.</p>

<p>The patient was started on Decadron, as well as Dilantin. In the Emergency Room she became hypertensive and was sent to the SICU. She was maintained on Nipride GTT.</p>

<p>In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was weaned off Nipride and then changed to Labetalol, Hydralazine. The patient was also noted to have cellulitis on her left knee and was initially maintained on Vancomycin and later changed to Keflex.</p>

<p>The patient was also evaluated by Radiation/Oncology, and it was decided that the patient would received a total of seven treatments of whole brain radiation therapy in conjunction with Decadron, as well as Dilantin.</p>

<p>During her Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient had increased alertness and was more oriented, although she does have a history of baseline dementia.</p>

<p>PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Metastatic melanoma status post resection in [**2138**] with recurrence in [**2146**] status post treatment with Taxol. History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with anticoagulation in the past. Status post PCM for sinoatrial dysfunction. History of coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2143**]. MIBI in [**2152-6-23**] showed an ejection fraction of 50%. History of hypercholesterolemia. History of hypertension, osteoarthritis, cellulitis. Status post skin graft. Peptic ulcer disease. History of bladder cancer. Chronic renal insufficiency.</p>

<p>ALLERGIES: AMOXICILLIN, OXACILLIN AND PERCOCET, REACTIONS UNKNOWN.</p>

<p>MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Imdur 30 mg, Warfarin, Lasix 20 q.d., Calcium Carbonate 1500 q.d., Vitamin D 4000 q.d., Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Protonix 40 q.d., Dietrol 2 mg b.i.d., Labetalol 300 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.</p>

<p>SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a home health aide. Husband died three months ago. She walks but recently was unable to do so. She otherwise has a very close family.</p>

<p>FAMILY HISTORY: On maternal side there is a history of diabetes, as well as hypertension.</p>

<p>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 96.5??????, blood pressure 161/47, pulse 74, respirations 14, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 L, 92% on room air. General: She was elderly, lying in bed. She was sometimes agitated and not following commands. She was nonverbal. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact. Dry mucous membranes. There was poor dentition. Neck: Supple. No lymphadenopathy. Heart: Regular, rate and rhythm. There was an early systolic ejection murmur, 3 out of 6. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Good bowel sounds. Extremities: There were bilateral skin eschars. The left knee had excoriation and was erythematous. Neurological: The patient was obtunded and not following commands. She had a limited neurologic exam. Cranial nerves II, III and IV intact. She was moving both hands with appropriate strength. No lifting of left arm off bed. Right lower extremity with decreased strength, apparently chronic secondary to polio. On the left lower extremity, she moved toes and feet.</p>

<p>LABORATORY DATA: On admission her white count was 6.4, hematocrit 37.5, platelet count 269, neutrophils 73, 22 lymphs, 3 monos; INR 1.1, PT 12.7, PTT 27.8; sodium 138, potassium 4.3, chloride 106, bicarb 22, BUN 36, creatinine 1.8, baseline 1.4-1.5; platelet count 151; calcium 10.6, magnesium 1.9, phos 3.1, CK 116, MB 5, troponin 0.04; Albumin 4.2; TSH 2.9; urinalysis with occasional bacteria, trace ketones, 30 protein.</p>

<p>Electrocardiogram was paced, lateral T-wave inversion, inferior T-wave inversion which new consistent with [**2152-6-23**].</p>

<p>Head CT showed three moderately large-sized mass lesions in the right posterior frontal, right anterior frontal lobe and left parietal lesion with significant edema. There was a small amount of peripheral density, question of hemorrhage or calcification.</p>

<p>Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, atelectasis, but no overt failure.</p>

<p>Knee films showed no fracture and no dislocation and degenerative changes with small right knee effusion.</p>

<p>HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Altered mental status: This was felt to be secondary to metastatic disease to the brain. The patient was evaluated by Radiation/Oncology, and it was decided that the patient would receive a total of seven treatments of whole-brain radiation therapy.</p>

<p>Additionally she was maintained on Decadron, as well as Dilantin. The patient had no seizure activity while in the hospital. She tolerated her Decadron well and tolerated her whole-brain radiation therapy without any complications.</p>

<p>The patient was discharged on a Decadron taper. Her Dilantin dose was increased to a total of 300 three times a day, given that her Dilantin level [**Company 2240**].i.d. was only 8. The patient will need her Dilantin level followed as an outpatient at her next appointment.</p>

<p>2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures while in the Emergency Room were noted to be 200/100; however, once she was transferred to the floor, she maintained very good control on a combination of Clonidine, Hydrochlorothiazide and Minoxidil, Hydralazine, as well as Labetalol 400 b.i.d. The patient's blood pressures were maintained in the 140s to 160s systolic, and it was decided that this was an appropriate range given that the patient needed to have adequate perfusion in the face of increased intracranial pressure.</p>

<p>3. Cellulitis: The patient was initially maintained on Vancomycin, and this was later changed to Keflex. The patient did not develop any rash or other complications Keflex. Her cellulitis was improved by the time of discharge.</p>

<p>4. Renal insufficiency: Her creatinine remained at baseline between 1.4-1.5.</p>

<p>5. Coronary artery disease: The patient was maintained on enteric coated Aspirin, as well as Labetalol. The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction, and her electrocardiogram remained stable without any EKG changes.</p>

<p>6. FEN: The patient was maintained on a soft diet, as well as thin liquids. She tolerated this without event. Additionally her electrolytes were followed daily and were repleted as needed. Her I&amp;Os were monitored closely.</p>

<p>7. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient is paced. She was rate controlled. She was held off all anticoagulation given her metastatic disease to the brain.</p>

<p>DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to her home because her family wanted the patient to do so. The patient has [**12-27**] full-time nurses that will be following her once she is discharged to home. Her mental status improved greatly while the patient was in the hospital. By the time of discharge, the patient was conversive and much more alert and oriented.</p>

<p>Her neurologic exam was significant for intact cranial nerves and the ability to move all extremities spontaneously. She did have limited movement in her arms, given that she has a history of bursitis. Otherwise, the patient's exam neurologically was much improved.</p>

<p>CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. She was stable on room air. She could not ambulate without assistance and does need help with all bed transfers. She was tolerating a p.o. diet without problems. [**Name (NI) **] mental status had improved considerably in that she was conversant, could move her extremities spontaneously, and cranial nerves were intact. Her strength was notable for weakness throughout but was symmetric.</p>

<p>DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Metastatic melanoma with metastases to the liver, lung and brain. 2. Hypertension. 3. Hypercholesterolemia. 5. Osteoarthritis. 6. Bursitis. 7. Cellulitis. 8. Chronic renal insufficiency. 9. Coronary artery disease. 10. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.</p>

<p>DISCHARGE STATUS: As stated above, the patient will be discharged to home with [**Hospital 2241**] nursing care. Home Hospice has been discussed with the family, and they would like to avail this possibility as the need arises.</p>

<p> History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 2251**] is a 70yoF with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy [**1-1**] aortic outflow obstruction, AICD s/p VT, CAD, COPD (on home O2) who presented with decreased UO and SOB, now transferred from medicine service to CCU for hypotension. Pt is currently somnolent and unable to provide a detailed history, so details are obtained from OMR and Atrius records. Pt saw NP in complex care clinic on [**7-10**], at that time felt well overall, c/o dry cough but denied SOB, peripheral edema. At that time her weight was recorded at 185 lbs (dry weight is estimated at 184 lbs). On [**7-17**] she called the CCC office c/o minimal urine output (&quot;only drops&quot;) and cough productive of yellow sputum. She reported compliance with her home diuretic regimen, but [**Name8 (MD) **] NP note she had not filled her aldactone rx. . On DOA, she called EMS due to increasing SOB. When EMS arrived her SBP was 80. She received 250cc NS and was brought to ED. In ED she had SBP 90s so received another 500cc NS bolus. CXR showed no e/o infiltrate but she was treated empirically for CAP with 1g ceftriaxone given her recent productive cough. Labs were significant for Na 121 and Cr 5.4 (baseline 3.5-4.0). She was admitted to medicine service. On the floor, her BP was initially 98/65 but then decreased to SBP 70s. She was transferred to CCU for pressor support. . On transfer, vitals were T 95.7, HR 60 (v-paced), BP 110/56, RR 18, O2sat 100% on 2LNC. She was drowsy, but denied current SOB, chest pain, palpitations, LE swelling. She endorsed orthopnea (c/w baseline) cough productive of yellow sputum, nausea, RUQ discomfort, and anuria. Denied recent fevers/chills, diarrhea/constipation, melena/hematochezia, BRBPR. . Of note she was admitted 1 month ago (from [**Date range (1) 2266**]) for CHF exacerbation and hypervolemia. She was started on a lasix drip with metolazone but was ultimately started on ultrafiltration with a tunneled HD line which she tolerated well. She has not required outpatient HD since discharge.</p>

<p>Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Admission 70yoF with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 35%), AICD p/w SOB and poor urine output for several days found to have hyponatremia, now transferred from medicine to CCU due to hypotension. . Active Issues: . #Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient was hypervolemic on exam with elevated JVP and increased abdominal distension at presentation. Given the patient had been refractory to diuretic therapy requiring ultrafiltration during her last hospitalization and was oliguric and hyponatremic on admission, ultrafiltration was initiated rather than diuretic therapy. She experienced significant muscle cramping and hypotension while on CVVHD requiring dopamine. CVVHD was discontinued on HD#2 and she was diuresed with IV lasix and metolazone. Pressures improved and she was weaned off of dopamine. It was noted that urine and blood pressure improved when the patient was in her native sinus rhythm with asynchronous ventricular pacing. Therefore the patients pacemaker escape rate was lowered to allow for increased native rhythm and the mode was changed to AAIR. Despite this change urine output remained poor and she was therefore started on a lasix drip ultimately requiring milrinone to augment diuresis. On HD#6 patient underwent placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter, and on HD#7 she continued HD using the tunneled line (see below). Lasix and metolazone were discontinued as patient will be HD dependent. . #Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive on admission in the setting of volume overload. Her hypotension was believed to be due to worsening cardiac output in setting of dilated cardiomyopathy. She was temporarily on a dopamine gtt, but this was weaned by HD#2. In addition, she experienced episodes of hypotension with CVVH with diuresis and antihypertensive medications, so her antihypertensive medications were held. On discharge, her BP was stable. She was asked to continue to hold her carvedilol and to follow up with her PCP about restarting as tolerated. . # Hyponatremia: Pts sodium was 119 on admission and likely cause of her AMS, thought to be hypervolemic hyponatremia with poor renal perfusion given e/o volume overload on exam and low urine Na. Her fluid intake was restricted to 1.5L daily, and she started CVVH as above with improvement in her hyponatremia as well as her mental status. At the time of discharge her sodium was 135. . # Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient was noted to have a creat of 5.4, baseline 3.5-4.0, and oliguria x 2-3 days on admission. As stated above she had previously required ultrafiltration during hospitalizations for heart failure exacerbation. Renal was consulted and felt that the patient would require chronic HD. Given her hypotension she was initally started on CVVH with dopamine gtt for pressure support.  However as above she did not tolerate CVVH and it was discontinued. She was diuresed with lasix gtt and milrinone as above until she had her tunneled line placed on HD#6. She tolerated HD well, with stable BP and no muscle cramping. Outpatient dialysis was arranged with [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] Dialysis Center for mondays, wednesdays and fridays. . # Afib: Pt has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin at home. On admission her coumadin was held in preparation for placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter. As stated above her pacemaker settings were changed and she was in sinus rhythm for most of her CCU course with heart rates in the 50-70s. Her mode was changed to AAIR to allow for intrinsice AV conduction and minimize ventricular pacing in an abnormal heart. Her coumadin was restarted at her home dose on HD#7. Her INR at the time of discharge was 1.4.</p>

<p># Stable issues: . # COPD: Patient's recent cough and SOB with h/o COPD was initially c/f COPD exacerbation, and she was initially started on prednisone and levofloxacin. However there was no wheezing on exam therefore prednisone and antibiotics were discontinued. She was continued on her home albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer treatments, and maintained O2 sats >90% on 2L NC (her baseline O2 requirement). . # CAD: Stable, no c/o chest pain during hospitalization. She was continued on her home ASA and pravastatin. . # HTN: Carvedilol was discontinued due to frequent episodes of hypotension (with SBP 70s-80s). She can resume as an outpatient if BP tolerates. . # Gout: Patient was continued on her home allopurinol and did not have any pain concerning for a gout flare. . # Transitional issues: - Patient maintained full code status throughout hospitalization. - She will continue outpatient hemodialysis at [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] Dialysis Center - She has follow-up scheduled with her PCP and her cardiologist.  She will be contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding a follow-up appointment with the device clinic in 3 months.</p>

<p>Brief Hospital Course: 71F with history of CHF, CAD, afib on coumadin, ESRD on HD and COPD presenting with LLE cellulitis. . # Cellulitis - patient with chronic ulcers on left lower extremity presented with inreased pain and erythema and elevated WBC consistent with cellulitis. She was recently treated for cellulitis in that leg with vancomycin on previous hospitalization in [**2194-1-28**]. After two days of vancomycin, she had marked improvement in the leg with decreased erythema in color and was dramatically receeding from the marked border below the area. There was still [**12-1**]+pitting edema in the left thigh, but improved compared to admission when it was harder and was obscuring the anatomical markings of the knee on extension. LENI of the leg was negative for DVT. She was seen by vascular surgery during this admission, who did not feel that surgery was indicated and agreed with the proposed medical management. -Vancomycin dosed with HD x 2 weeks (last day [**4-28**]) -Ciprofloxacin 500mg po qday x 2 weeks (last day [**4-28**]) . #Hypotension - patient hypotensive to SBPs in 80s. In the ED there was concern that she was possibly septic, so she was admited to the ICU. She received 1.5L of IV fluids and her BP repsonded well. Her baseline blood pressure is in the low 90s systolic. After being on the floor she continued to have lower blood pressures and was asymptomatic with them. -She will require monitoring of her blood pressure during [**Month/Year (2) 2286**] sessions . # Afib - on amiodarone and coumadin as outpatient. Stable. INR therapeutic at 2.1 on admission. Continued on home medications - cont warfarin and amiodarone . # CAD - Continued on amiodarone, pravastatin and SLNGT . # COPD - on spiriva, alubterol and fluticasone at home. Also uses 2L NC at night at home. Has had cough for the past [**3-6**] weeks and recently started on doxycycline on [**4-10**], which was continued for planned 7 day course total and will be completed on [**4-16**]. No worsening SOB. CXR showed no evidence of PNA . # chronic sytolic CHF - Continued on home furosemide dose. Patinet is not on ACEI prior to this admission, and this was not started given her hypotension. . # ESRD - Continued on HD schedule of T-TH-SAT. She received an extra ultrafiltration session on [**4-17**] (friday) to try to remove more fluid from her left leg. .
